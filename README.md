# Electric Vehicle (EV) Sales Study

**Data Source:** Utilized comprehensive dataset from Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) covering Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV).

**Techniques Applied:**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed in-depth analysis to identify trends, demographic patterns, and EV type distribution over time.

**Data Cleaning:** Streamlined dataset by refining column names, eliminating irrelevant fields, and correcting data types for analytical accuracy.

**Predictive Modeling:** Implemented a k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) model to forecast EV model preferences with a 77.95% accuracy rate, enhancing inventory management, demand forecasting, and personalized recommendations.

**Key Findings:**
- Identified a significant correlation between government policies, charging infrastructure availability, and EV adoption rates.
- Revealed demographic and geographical patterns influencing EV adoption, highlighting the importance of targeted government incentives.
- Demonstrated the evolving preference for BEVs over PHEVs, attributed to improved battery technology and public awareness of environmental issues.

**Impact:** The study provides valuable insights for manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers, guiding strategic decisions towards sustainable transportation solutions.
