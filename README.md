# Electric-Vehicle-Population-Data-Using-R

The research aims to leverage technological advancements to support electric vehicle (EV) enthusiasts. Through comprehensive data analysis, we seek to enhance our understanding of EV economy, battery performance, and user behavior. This study is vital 
for refining EV design, overcoming early challenges, and predicting future trends. Our initiative serves as a valuable resource for manufacturers, governments, and consumers, empowering them to make informed decisions based on empirical evidence. 
Manufacturers can improve cars, governments can shape infrastructure and regulations, and consumers can make informed choices. Our analysis aims to provide information and enhance decision-making in the EV market, promoting the adoption of 
greener and more efficient transportation alternatives.

The dataset contains electric car data, and in this project, we are targeting to perform data analysis on this data. The attributes of every completely electric 
passenger car are listed in this dataset. The dataset contains data on two types of electric vehicles i.e., Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric 
Vehicles (PHEV) which are registered through the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL).
